This is a collection of scripts to assist system administrators in using the
Debian Tor and related packages as a base for a Tor chroot. It is hard coded
and specific to Debian at this time.

Run the following:

 make install

Setup the chroot:

 tor-chroot-update.sh

You must now copy over a torrc that is proper:

 cp /etc/tor/torrc /home/tor-chroot/etc/tor/torrc

Start your chroot'ed Tor:

 /etc/init.d/tor-chroot start
